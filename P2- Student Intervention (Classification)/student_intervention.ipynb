There are several variations of boosting, but generally it involves taking a subset of the dataset (subset of samples and/or of features), training a weak learner, select another subset of the data which were badly classified, training another weak learner, and iterate away.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several boosting algorithms. Gradient boosting works by building the model \"in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, with several weak learners, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.\" It is \"based on the observation by Leo Breiman (which published the first paper on boosting) that boosting can be interpreted as an optimization algorithm on a suitable cost function\".

A disadvantage is having to train several weak learners instead of one strong learner, so it takes a long time to learn compared to other single learner algorithms. Several examples of using Gradient Boosting can be found in Kaggle.

    "Given the available data is limited, and based on the results, I would chose k-nearest neighbors. A non parametric model will allow you to quickly incorporate the knowledge of a new observation. Training a kNN with 300 samples only takes 0.0007 of a second, which is 100 times faster than training a parametric classifier with similar performance (Gradient Boosting). On the other hand, predicting will take 0.002 seconds, which is about 4 times longer than the prediction time of Gradient Boosting. The trade-off here is in favour of kNN, even more considering new observations are added every day (students graduate), at almost the same ratio you need to do new predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "F1_score of kNN, which is a balanced ration of precision recall, is also above the results for the best performing parametric classifier in the three different training sizes tested. For 300 samples, kNN has a f1 score of 0.7852, compared to 0.7576 of Gradient Boosting\n",

Decision Tree has a .29 (1-0.71) difference between f1 score in the training data versus f1 score in the test data, Gradient Boosting a 0.21 (.97-.76) difference, while kNN has a small difference of .8 (.86-.78). The proximity between the f1 score curve for training and test set is a good sign that model has not overfitted."

    "The process is simple. Imagine you are trying to predict whether or not it is going to rain today. You have data for the past 100 days of umidity and temperature, and you decide to plot this data. In the x-axis is the temperature, in the y-axis the umidity, and each day is a dot in the visualization. If it is day that rained, the dot is blue, if it did not rain, the dot is red. \n",

    "You know what the temperature and umidity will be tomorrow, but you don't know if it will rain or not. An easy way to find out is to plot your new data point in the visualization, and look at the dots nearby. Are they blue or red? If most of them are blue, you can infer that the new dot is probably also blue, which means it will rain tomorrow. On the other hand, if the nearby dots are mostly red, it means tomorrow it won't probably rain.\n",

With the help of linear algebra, you can calculate the distance between the dots in a n-dimensional space, not limited to 2, and know which dots are near the new dot you just entered (let's say you also collect data of air polllution and hours of sunlight, then you go from a 2 dimensional space to a 4 dimensional space). The k stands for how many neighbors will you analyze. If k=3, for example, you look at the three closest dots to determine whether it will rain or not.\n",

    "The final model f1 score is 0.8150 for training set and 0.8054 for testing set. Those are much better than the untuned model, which had .8604 for training set and .7852 for the testing set. The difference between then is down to .01, which means we are near the optimal point where the the two score curves approximate. Our model generalizes well to unseen dataset, and it is not overfitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an improvement from .785 to .805 in the testing set f1 score. A 0.02 improvement is a great achievement at this point. An 0.805 f2 score is a good result, so given no other premises, we can assume our  model is not underfitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth discussing some parameters chosen for the final model. It uses the euclidean distance (which is equivalent to the minkowski distance with the power parameter set to 2), and 17 nearest neighbors. The algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors is known as ball_tree. Leaf_size has not impact on the model performance, only in training time. "
